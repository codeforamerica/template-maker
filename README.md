# template-maker

The template maker is a Flask app that allows you to generate templates and then use those templates to generate documents.

### How is this app organized?

There are two primary flask blueprints that power this app: **builder** and **consumer**. **Builder** generates templates that can then be turned into actual forms via the **consumer**. The idea is to have a small working set of templates that are used to generate the vast majority of documents, instead of allowing total flexibility every time (a l√° something like [formbuilder.js](https://github.com/dobtco/formbuilder) or google forms). The **builder** operates as a single-page application powered by Flask and Postgres to maintain state and angular.js to handle the client-side interaction.

### How do I develop on it?

Good question, thanks for asking! The app is a combination of Flask and Angular.js for the most part. To get it all to run, you'll need to install some dependencies.

##### Developing the Flask Backend

It is highly recommended that you use use [virtualenv](https://readthedocs.org/projects/virtualenv/) (and [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for convenience). For a how-to on getting set up, please consult this [howto](https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/Python-Virtualenv.md).

Then run the following commands to bootstrap your environment:

    # clone the repo
    git clone https://github.com/codeforamerica/template-maker
    # change into the repo directory
    cd template-maker
    # install python dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # upgrade your database to the latest version
    python manage.py db upgrade
    # run the server
    python manage.py server

NOTE: If this is the first time that you are working with template-maker, be sure to run the following command (before starting your server) to stamp your database and allow for future migrations:

    python manage.py db stamp head

##### Developing the Angular frontend

template-maker uses [`npm`](https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/Node.js.md) and [`bower`](http://bower.io/) to manage its front-end dependencies. Ensure you have `npm` and `node` installed (see the howto link for more information), and then run

    $ npm install
    $ bower install

to install the necessary libraries. Because template-maker uses `flask-assets` to actually package and serve assets, you don't need to do anything else, just run the python server as above!


### Running Tests

The test suite is split into two parts -- python test and javascript tests.

##### Running the python tests

Python tests are still in the works, and when they are implemented, this document will be updated with additional instructions.

##### Running the javascript tests

The template-maker uses [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html) as a test runner and [mocha](http://mochajs.org/) as a testing framework, [chai](http://chaijs.com/) for assertions, and occasionally [sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) for stubbing. The tests run in a [phantom.js](http://phantomjs.org/) headless browser. All test dependencies should have been installed when `npm install` was run above.

Tests are controlled by the `Gruntfile` in the top-level directory. The simplest way to run the tests is to simply run

    $ grunt test:unit

This will run the tests and output a basic coverage report to the console. There are some additional options for running tests as well:

If you want to continuously be running tests in the background, you can use

    $ grunt karma:continuous

You can also generate more detailed html coverage reports (avalable to view in the coverage-js directory) by running

    $ grunt karma:coverage

### Who made it?

The template maker is a project of the 2015 Pittsburgh Code for America [fellowship team](http://codeforamerica.org/governments/pittsburgh)
