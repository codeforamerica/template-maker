'NONDISCRIMINATION_CERTIFICATION': '''
<h1>APPENDIX A</h1>
<p>To Request for Proposals for City of Pittsburgh</p>
<h2>NON-DISCRIMINATION</h2>
<p>
Non-discrimination and equal opportunity are the policy of the Commonwealth
and the City of Pittsburgh in all its decisions, programs, and activities.  The
purpose is to achieve the aims of the United States and Pennsylvania
Constitutions.  Executive Order 1972-1, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act,
Act of October 27, 1955, (P.L. 744), as amended, (43 P.S. & 951, et. seq.), and (43
P.S. & 153), and the Pittsburgh City Code (Chapters 651 through 659), by assuring
that all persons are accorded equal employment opportunity without regard to
race, color, religious creed, handicap, ancestry, national origin, place of birth, age, sex, or sexual orientation.
</p>
<p>
During the term of this contract, the Consultant agrees as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Consultant shall not discriminate against any employee, applicant for
employment, independent Consultant or any other person because of race, color,
religious creed, ancestry, national origin, age, sexual orientation, sex or disability.
Consultant shall take affirmative action to insure that applicants are employed, and that
employees or agents are treated during employment, without regard to their race, color,
religious creed, ancestry, national origin, age, sex, sexual orientation or disability. Such
affirmative action shall include, but is not limited to, the following: employment,
upgrading, demotion or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or
termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training.
Consultant shall post in conspicuous places available to employees, agents, applicants
for employment, and other persons, a notice to be provided by the contracting agency
setting forth the provision of this non-discrimination certification.
</li>
<li>
Consultant shall state in advertisements or requests for employment placed
by it or on its behalf, that all qualified applicants will receive consideration for
employment without regard to race, color, religious creed, handicap, ancestry, national
origin, age, sex, sexual orientation or disability.
</li>
<li>
Consultant shall send each labor union or workers' representative with whom
it has a collective bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding, a notice
advising said labor union or worker's representative of its commitment to this non-
discrimination certification.  Similar notice shall be sent to every other source of
recruitment regularly utilized by bidder.
</li>
<li>
It shall be no defense to a finding of non-compliance with this non-
discrimination certification that Consultant has delegated some of its employment
practices to any union, training program, or other source of recruitment which prevents it
from meeting its obligations.  However, if the evidence indicates that the Consultant was
not on notice of the third-party discrimination or made a good faith effort to correct it;
such factor shall be considered in mitigation in determining appropriate sanctions.
</li>
<li>
Where the practices of a union, or of any training program or other source of
recruitment, will result in the exclusion of minority group persons, so that Consultant will
be unable to meet its obligations under this non-discrimination certification, Consultant
Request For Proposals – City of Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations
shall then employ and fill vacancies through other non-discriminatory employment procedures.
</li>
<li>
Consultant shall comply with all state and federal laws prohibiting
discrimination in hiring or employment opportunities. In the event of Consultant's non-
compliance with the non-discrimination certification or with any such laws, this contract
may be terminated or suspended, in whole or part, and Consultant may be declared
temporarily ineligible for further City of Pittsburgh contracts, and other sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked.
</li>
<li>
Consultant shall furnish all necessary employment documents and records
to, and permit access to its books, records, and accounts by the City of Pittsburgh for
purposes of investigation to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this certification.
If Consultant does not possess documents or records reflecting the necessary
information requested, it shall furnish such information on reporting forms supplied by the City of Pittsburgh.
</li>
<li>
Consultant shall actively recruit minority and women sub-Consultants or sub-
Consultants with substantial minority representation among their employees.
</li>
<li>
Consultant shall include the provisions of this non-discrimination certification
in every sub-contract, so that such provisions will be binding upon each sub-Consultant.
</li>
<li>
Consultant's obligations under this clause are limited to the Consultant's
facilities within Pennsylvania, or where the contract is for purchase of goods
manufactured outside of Pennsylvania, the facilities at which such goods are actually produced.
</li>
